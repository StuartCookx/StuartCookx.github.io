<p>An rdc is similar to a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer including two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves. Nevertheless, it typically does not consist of shutoff valves, may or may not be equipped with test dicks or ports, and is usually less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but must be used to isolate just nonhealth hazards and is meant for usage just in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
