<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high risk" facilities.</p>
