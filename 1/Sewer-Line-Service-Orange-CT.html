Failing to repair a running toilet can lead to wasted water and a very high water bill. Water in Florida is expensive so do not postpone-- get a running toilet repaired.

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
