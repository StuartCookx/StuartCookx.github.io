<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct result on your security, convenience, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system.

When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
