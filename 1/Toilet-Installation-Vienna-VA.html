<p>In local water system systems, water is typically preserved at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow to and out of the plumbing components in your home or business. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance happens, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an incident, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention method utilized. The best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). The correct backflow prevention device is required if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>

Prior to leaving the home, the service technician restored water flow and evaluated the pipe.</p>
