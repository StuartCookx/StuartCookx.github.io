Momentary water will be enabled after the contractor sets up a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be connected to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker need to be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser needs to be firmly connected to strong rebar or wooden stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing prior to the structure is considerably complete is prohibited unless a check backflow assembly is installed and immediately evaluated to ensure it is working.</p>
