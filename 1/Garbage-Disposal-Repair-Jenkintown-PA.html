Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
