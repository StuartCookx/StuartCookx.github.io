The Supertech serviced our air conditioner system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather.

I would extremely suggest Hunter for any concerns you may have.</p>

Mechanical gauges used to measure test pressures shall have a variety such that the greatest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be performed utilizing a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure required for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as indicated by pressure evaluates during inspection will be deemed to show the existence of a leak.</p>
