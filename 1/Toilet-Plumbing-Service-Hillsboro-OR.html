If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>
