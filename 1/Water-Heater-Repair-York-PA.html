<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its typical flow. IRWD's potable water system is developed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "regular," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the capacity for polluted water getting in the drinkable water distribution system. Copper is a biostatic product, which indicates germs will not grow on it. Copper has been utilized (in addition to PVC pipes) since the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings. It is especially useful for cold and hot faucet water and refrigerant lines in HEATING AND COOLING systems.</p>
