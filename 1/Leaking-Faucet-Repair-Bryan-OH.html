<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to business? The timing of regeneration depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water really needs it. Newer units use digital sensors that keep an eye on bead deficiency and other key metrics based on your water use and for that reason only regenerate when needed. These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
