<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in many locations have actually significantly lowered the number of reported incidents that take place within our water systems. This has at times led to people believing that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever actually have actually been an issue in the very first location. This thinking can be both detrimental and dangerous. Backflow events in water supply are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a reduced pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or nothing approach to backflow defense. We need to look at each installation for the danger it provides and after that install the correct security.</p>
