Like any machine, a sink has several parts that need repair and maintenance over time. A plumbing permit offers three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections hired on work not completed, not effectively installed, or on an inaccessible residential or commercial property will require re-inspection. It is the authorization holder's responsibility to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the residential or commercial property.</p>
