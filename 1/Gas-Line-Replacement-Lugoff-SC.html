It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.
