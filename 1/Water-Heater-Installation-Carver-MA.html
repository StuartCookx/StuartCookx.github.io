<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully regenerated.</p>
