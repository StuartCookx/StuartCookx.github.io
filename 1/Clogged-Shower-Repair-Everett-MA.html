<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the defective pipes replaced.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
