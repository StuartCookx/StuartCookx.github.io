<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I love to cook, I produce a whole lot of meals. We established a momentary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we recognized that we required the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will remain clog-free for 30 days. If it clogs again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely delighted that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company again and again in the future.</p>

As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
