Call (866) 701-5306 to set up an appointment. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically defined by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional usage, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
