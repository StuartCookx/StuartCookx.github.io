<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the quantity of trash that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the trash is handled through already existing water facilities.</p>
