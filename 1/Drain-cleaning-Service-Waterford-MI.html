For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like damp sand.

<p>Finally, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
