Not that I would know from experience. When to repair: Under no scenarios should your toilet move when you press or sit on it.

<p>Standpipe systems are used in numerous centers, these systems are designed to supply water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets tactically installed inside a structure.

There are 2 types of standpipe systems, the first type, are dry systems, which normally contain no long-term water system and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire personnel responding to an incident. A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention protection. The second type is a wet standpipe system which is usually linked to the buildings safe and clean water system and needs the installation of a double check valve assembly.</p>
<p>A freshly set up water heater must not produce odd noises, however it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater runs to warm the water. Things get worse drastically for homes with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
