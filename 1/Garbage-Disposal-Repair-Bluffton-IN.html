Electric water heaters have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability. Still, the difference is insufficient to make any considerable modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electrical alternative will last about 8-12 years.</p>
