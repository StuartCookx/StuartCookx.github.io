<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I love to prepare, I generate a great deal of meals. We established a short-lived workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we realized that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.

If it blocks again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!
