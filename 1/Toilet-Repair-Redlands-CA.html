<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best used in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
