<p>It is common for hot water heater to leak due to varying pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve belongs to the system for that exact reason. But while little drips ought to not be trigger for issue, homeowners need to watch on the water heater leaks. All significant plumbing code bodies address security against backflow in safe and clean supply of water systems. All possible or existing cross connections need to be safeguarded from backflow by the installation of an appropriate backflow prevention device. Consult Public Health for more specific details on code requirements.</p>
<p>A reduction in supply side pressure triggered by an occurrence such as a water main break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire battling, causes the supply pressure to drop listed below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve permits the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure again goes beyond the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
