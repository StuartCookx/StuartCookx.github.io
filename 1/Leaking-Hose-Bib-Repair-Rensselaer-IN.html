<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
