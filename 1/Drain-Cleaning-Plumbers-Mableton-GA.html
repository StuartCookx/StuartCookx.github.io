Our premium system, the EC4 whole house water softener, is a state-of-the-art item that utilizes a procedure of ion exchange to eliminate the minerals that trigger hard water. By replacing the magnesium, bicarbonate, and calcium ions that trigger water solidity with sodium or potassium ions, the EC4 softens hard water by addressing its source. Moreover, thanks to its distinct, integrated microprocessor, the EC4 system will learn your common water use patterns, changing its soft water delivery based upon your requirements. In this method, our premium water softener makes sure that you'll have an unlimited supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>

<p>You must see the distinction in your house's plumbing right now. The flow of water will come much easier from faucets and water pressure will enhance. Monthly water bills will enhance as well, and you can expect to need few to no repairs for leaks and obstructions throughout the next couple of years. With appropriate maintenance, your re-piping will last for numerous generations. Is your current kitchen sink missing a waste disposal unit? Or maybe you've had us replace your old kitchen sink and need a new disposal for it. Bonney Plumbing can make your kitchen complete with the right size garbage disposal installation to meet your commercial or residential requirements.</p>
<p>Standard water softeners found in house supply and hardware stores will eliminate nearly all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water throughout the softening process. Softeners also will eliminate as much as 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water supplies with high levels of iron and manganese (greater than 10 ppm) might need pretreatment to extend the life-span of a water softener. The results of a malfunctioning toilet differ greatly-- from the moderate inconvenience of a tank that will not stop going to the unsanitary and potentially dreadful back-up of unflushed sewage.
