This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is necessary to get rid of the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and lack of moving parts. However, it might be unwise in many scenarios to install a pipe section of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
