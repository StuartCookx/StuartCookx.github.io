<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

The unit must grind the waste even finer to avoid clogs and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields.
