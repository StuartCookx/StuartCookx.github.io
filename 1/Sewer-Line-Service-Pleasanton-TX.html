<p>There are two popular install systems utilized for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt install (if you've had actually a disposer installed for a long time, it's most likely installed in this manner) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock"). Each accomplish the very same job with little distinction, aside from their installation.

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
