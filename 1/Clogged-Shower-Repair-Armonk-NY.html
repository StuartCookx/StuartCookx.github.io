<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Armonk NY</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its numerous desired uses around your home.</p>
