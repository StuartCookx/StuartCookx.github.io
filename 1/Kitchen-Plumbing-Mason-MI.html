<p>Salt intake from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking.

This cleaning process, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: backwash, rinse and recharge. The regrowth procedure can be arranged automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>

<p>If you have a dishwasher, or want to get one down the line, then make sure the waste disposal unit you put in has an attachment for this.

<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regrowth depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water in fact requires it. Newer systems utilize electronic sensors that monitor bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water use and therefore only regrow when required. These more recent systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
