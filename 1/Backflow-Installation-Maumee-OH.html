<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. For double-bowl sinks, the best method to set about things is to utilize a constant waste disposer set consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece.

To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and rotate the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
