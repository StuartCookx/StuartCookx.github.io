Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
