Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
