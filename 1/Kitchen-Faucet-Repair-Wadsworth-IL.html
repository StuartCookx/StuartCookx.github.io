These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never ever exactly matches supply.
