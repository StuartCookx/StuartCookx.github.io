All your drains empty into the main sewer lines and when it is running correctly, it will flow to the city's sewer line.

<p>The Plumbing Division of the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department is responsible for ensuring that plumbing systems and proficient trade persons are in compliance with code and ordinance requirements.

<p>To reduce the need of gas line repair, it's important to comprehend the common causes of gas leakages. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning appliances occur most typically in the winter season.

If you have not done so currently, we advise setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to signal you of any potential gas leaks.</p>
