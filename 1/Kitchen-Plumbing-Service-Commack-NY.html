<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the method laid out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. This is particularly true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
