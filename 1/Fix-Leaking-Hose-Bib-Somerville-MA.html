Read our reviews to see what people are saying about our hot water heater services. It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has required several repairs over the last couple of years.

If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>

<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Somerville MA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger.
