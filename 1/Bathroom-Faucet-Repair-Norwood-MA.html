<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
