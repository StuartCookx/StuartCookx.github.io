<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
