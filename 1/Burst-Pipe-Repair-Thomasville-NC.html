<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
