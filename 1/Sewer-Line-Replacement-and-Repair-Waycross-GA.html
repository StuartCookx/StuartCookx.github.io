<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your house. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
