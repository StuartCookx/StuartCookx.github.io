<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is delicate to water pressure and relies on a good balance of water pressure in order to work successfully. If your showers become disappointing, or it appears little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair.

<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
<p>Slow drains. A slow drain can be a typical plumbing problem, and most blockages can be resolved with a basic fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. The concern can be a much deeper blockage somewhere in the main sewer line if the basic unclogging approaches do not work to solve the slow drain. Sadly, mainline obstructions are generally much bigger blockages than require more than basic unclogging approaches, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
