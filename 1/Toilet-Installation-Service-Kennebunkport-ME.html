Call (866) 701-5306 to arrange a consultation. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly defined by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain in addition to preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.
