<p>Atmospheric vacuum breaker. Although you may have a number of atmospheric vacuum breakers on your system, the water will just stream through one of them on its way to the emitters or sprinklers. For that reason, you just include the pressure loss for one vacuum breaker in your estimation.

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regrowed.</p>
