<p>This is among the very first and main questions that you ought to ask yourself when it concerns repiping and replacing plumbing in your home. The age of your home is a vital part to understand whether you ought to repipe your house.

If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we highly recommend that you hire a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping.
