<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" facilities.</p>
