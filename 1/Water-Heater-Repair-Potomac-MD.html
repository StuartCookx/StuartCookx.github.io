<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Potomac MD</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated annually to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
