<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
