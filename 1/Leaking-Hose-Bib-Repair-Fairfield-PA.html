How frequently a toilet obstructions depends on the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush.

<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange).
