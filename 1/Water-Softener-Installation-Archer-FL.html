<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Your pipes are a major element of your plumbing system, responsible for moving water all throughout your house. Gradually, however, your plumbing pipes can break, leading to leaks and obstructions. This is specifically true in older houses, where old, steel piping has not yet been replaced with more resilient copper or plastic piping. Repiping is the job of changing an old our malfunctioning length of pipe in your house with a brand-new one. Sometimes, whole-house repiping might be required to replace all the pipes in your house.</p>
<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in numerous parts of the plumbing system, many typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves.
