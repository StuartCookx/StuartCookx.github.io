The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system.

One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
