<p>If you identify a leak and select a patching job instead of a repiping task, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same product and they may be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
