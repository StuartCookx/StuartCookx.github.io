<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls under this short section of pipe prior to it can reach the hot water heater's control valve. The needed length of the drip leg varies.

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Trees and shrubs are a typical reason for sewer clogs to the house.
