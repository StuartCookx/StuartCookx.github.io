<p>The next action for a hopeful plumbing contractor is to earn a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing service and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors normally consist of paying an application charge and passing a thorough organisation, law and building regulations exam. Some community colleges and technical schools provide contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Additional requirements for potential plumbing entrepreneur might consist of proof of financial trustworthiness, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
