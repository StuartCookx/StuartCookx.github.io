<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system as the outcome of the downstream pressure being greater than the supply pressure. This reduction in supply pressure happens whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water mains).

Newer units use electronic sensors that monitor bead deficiency and other crucial metrics based upon your water use and for that reason only restore when required. These newer systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect because they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
