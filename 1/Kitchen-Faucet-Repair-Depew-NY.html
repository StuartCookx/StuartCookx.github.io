Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.

<p>Search for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>

<p>Broken sewer pipes can be more than simply an expensive repair-- they can result in pricey and substantial home damage and cause major health risks.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close.
