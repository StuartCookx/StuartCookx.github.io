<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
