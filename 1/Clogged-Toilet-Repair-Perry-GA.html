<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
