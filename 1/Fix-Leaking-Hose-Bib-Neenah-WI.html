There are two types of standpipe systems, the first type, are dry systems, which normally consist of no long-term supply of water and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire workers reacting to an incident.

Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
