<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5). Examine the instructions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
