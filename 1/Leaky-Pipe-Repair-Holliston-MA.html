Prevent difficult water from damaging your toilet and bathroom plumbing. If you think a gas leak, initially call your local utility company then call a plumber.

<p>Waste disposal unit are designed to work in one of 2 ways. Either through what's referred to as a batch feed, where the system is filled, then covered before it is turned on, or through a constant feed, where the system can be filled while it is running.
