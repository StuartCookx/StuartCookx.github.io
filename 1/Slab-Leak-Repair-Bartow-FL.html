<p>Trees and shrubs are a typical reason for sewer blockages to the home. Roots can turn into the tiniest crack or gap in your house's drain pipe, where they grow in the nutrient abundant environment provided by the sewer. Flat roofs typically have drains spaced out around their perimeter. The drains are linked to vertical pipes that are generally connected to underground horizontal pipes linked to municipal storm drains. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to bring back flow and avoid water collection on top of the structure's roofing.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered fully regrowed.</p>
