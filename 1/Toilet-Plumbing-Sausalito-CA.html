<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Sausalito CA</h3>
<p>If your polybutylene pipes have actually failed, read your insurance plan completely. Ensure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance provider will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be rejected because the standard HO-3 house owners' policy specifically excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged period of time."

As soon as you have checked out your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered, double check with your agent to validate that your understanding is proper.</p>
