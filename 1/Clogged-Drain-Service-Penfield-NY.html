<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are captured and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any remaining pollutants.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.
