<p>Re-piping is a procedure of replacing the supply pipes in a house or service. It is not a temporary fix or a replacement of short sections of pipe, but a complete replacement of your supply plumbing system. There are a number of reasons you might need to repipe your home or business. Rust of pipes may cause low water pressure, rusty colored water, reduced water circulation, or leaks. If you are going to renovate it is a good time to repipe before you paint or finish your walls.  It is very important to understand the scope of the project prior to work is started. If you discover a separated leak or a little portion of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are worn away or broken, it is rather perhaps an indicator of a larger problem.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You might need to look into using a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
