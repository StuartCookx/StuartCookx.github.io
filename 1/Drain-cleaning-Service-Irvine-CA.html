Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of intended uses around your house.</p>
