<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
