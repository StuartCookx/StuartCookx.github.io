<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future.

A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid generally will help eliminate them. If you would like to attempt the gentlest technique perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and safety cautions initially!), if that does not do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust stains and it's readily available at the majority of hardware shops.</p>
