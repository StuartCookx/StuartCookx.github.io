<p>If your polybutylene pipes have failed, read your insurance plan completely. Make sure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be rejected because the basic HO-3 homeowners' policy specifically omits "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged period of time." Call your insurance coverage representative and validate your coverage. Once you have read through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, check with your agent to validate that your understanding is appropriate.</p>

To prevent such an event, there requires to be some kind of backflow prevention technique utilized. The best and most safe type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The proper backflow prevention device is needed if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
