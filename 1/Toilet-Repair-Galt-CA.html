<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
