It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

Moreover, the tankless hot water heater system does not have much of the problems that the tank hot water heater have.
