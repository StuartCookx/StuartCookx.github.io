<p>In local water system systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to stream to and out of the plumbing components in your home or company. When the pressure drops for some factor such as might happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other scenario occurs, infected water may be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach utilized. The best and safest kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air space is not possible, then the proper backflow prevention device is needed.
