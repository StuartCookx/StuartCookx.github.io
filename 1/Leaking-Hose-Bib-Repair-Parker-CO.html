<p>In local water system systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or business. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may occur when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other scenario happens, infected water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention method utilized. The very best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the proper backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
<p>The check assembly was developed in the 1950s for the fire defense market, creating a redundancy created to make sure that one check valve will continue to protect the city supply of water even if the other fails. This assembly also makes it possible for the closure of one valve to lower the pressure differential across the other, developing a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor backflow leakage. Test cocks, or little ball valves, allow the attachment of testing equipment that examines whether the check assembly is functional.</p>
