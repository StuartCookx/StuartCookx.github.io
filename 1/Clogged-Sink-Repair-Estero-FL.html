Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
