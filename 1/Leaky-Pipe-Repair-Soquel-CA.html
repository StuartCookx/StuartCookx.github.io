Call (866) 701-5306 to set up an appointment. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not frequently defined by water purveyors.  It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional use, water pressure pushes the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure versus back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
<p>Lastly, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best utilized in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
