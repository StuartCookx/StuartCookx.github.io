<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Shrewsbury MA</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
