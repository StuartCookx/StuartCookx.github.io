As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of intended usages around your house.</p>
