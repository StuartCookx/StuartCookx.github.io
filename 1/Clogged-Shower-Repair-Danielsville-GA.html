A great way to decrease the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit. Quickly and effectively eliminating leftover potato peels, fruit rinds and lots of other kinds of food waste, the disposal grinds all of it into fine particles that are eliminated of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>

Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
