Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
