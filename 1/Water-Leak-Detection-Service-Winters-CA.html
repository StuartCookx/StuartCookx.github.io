<p>Surprise! The majority of brand-new disposals don't featured a cable and plug. If your old unit has a cord and plug, you can eliminate the entire assembly and reinstall it on the brand-new system.

During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
