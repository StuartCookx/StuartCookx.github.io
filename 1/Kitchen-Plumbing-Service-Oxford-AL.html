Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
