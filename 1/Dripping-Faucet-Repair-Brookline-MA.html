<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will cause your water to look rusty or brown, and the water may have a bad or foul smell to it. When the piping in your home begins to reveal any of these indications of corrosion, you will inevitably need to repipe the entire plumbing system.

When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
