<p>In unusual instances a CPVC repipe maybe suggested where the water PH levels are a problem. With this approach, our technicians make insertions or holes at both ends of the damaged sewer pipe. They then insert a brand-new replacement pipe on one end and pull it through the old pipe's course utilizing a hydraulic machine. This triggers the old pipe to burst or split in order to replace it with a brand-new, stronger, extremely long lasting and leak-resistant sewer pipe without needing to collect the old one first.</p>
