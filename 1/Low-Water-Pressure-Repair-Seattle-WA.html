<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
