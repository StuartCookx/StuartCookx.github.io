Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
