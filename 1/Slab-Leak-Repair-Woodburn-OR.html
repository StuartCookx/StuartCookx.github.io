<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop listed below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve allows the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Without a water softener, laundry demands extra detergent to prevent it from looking dingy. Meals will come out of your dishwasher stained and streaked. Filmy residue develops on your shower curtains and your soap and shampoo will not lather. Bathing in hard water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair sticky and lifeless. The sheer quantity of energy, money, and time needed to tidy up the destructive side effects of tough water is excessive. An entire house water softener is the option to the scourge of water firmness.</p>
