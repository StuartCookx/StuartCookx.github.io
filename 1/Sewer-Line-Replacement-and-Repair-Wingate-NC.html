<p>If you find a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping job, simply bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the very same product and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your entire home when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
