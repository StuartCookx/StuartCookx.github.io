<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is needed to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its design and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be impractical in lots of situations to install a pipe section of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>

Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
