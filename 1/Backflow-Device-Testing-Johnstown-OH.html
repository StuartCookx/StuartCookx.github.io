Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future.

This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
