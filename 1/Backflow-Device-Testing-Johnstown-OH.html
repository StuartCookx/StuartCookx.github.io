<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future.

The age of your home is a vital component to understand whether or not you should repipe your home.

You may need to check out using a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
