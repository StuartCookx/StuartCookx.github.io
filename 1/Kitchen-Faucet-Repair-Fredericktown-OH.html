<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
