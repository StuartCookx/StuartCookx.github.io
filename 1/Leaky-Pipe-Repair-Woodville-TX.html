<p>Standpipe systems are utilized in numerous facilities, these systems are designed to provide water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets tactically installed inside a structure. These systems typically are installed in big, open areas within structures, and in multistory buildings for the purpose of manual firefighting. Standpipe systems can offer early fire suppression in these structures making it capable for a single person or firefighter to use a quick and reliable  action to fire. There are 2 types of standpipe systems, the very first type, are dry systems, which generally consist of no permanent water system and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire personnel responding to an event. A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention defense. The 2nd type is a damp standpipe system which is typically connected to the buildings potable water system and needs the installation of a double check valve assembly.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

If it was built before 1970, it might have pipes made from an out-of-date product that will start to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't currently). And if your home was constructed prior to World War II, then it probably needs replacements for its old pipes, probably whole-house repiping.</p>
