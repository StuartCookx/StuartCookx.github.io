For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and break or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the space along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
