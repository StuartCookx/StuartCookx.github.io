<p>An rdc resembles a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer including two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves. Nevertheless, it generally does not include shutoff valves, might or may not be equipped with test dicks or ports, and is typically less reliable than a DC. An rdc works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but need to be used to isolate just nonhealth risks and is intended for use just in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
