<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads become loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is warmed, hard water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to decrease these symptoms.</p>
<p>Any sewer-related checks will require a camera inspection. For a sewer camera inspection, a camera can be put down the drain in a sink to check the pipes in your house, or an outdoor pipe to inspect the sewer main in the yard. Sewer cams can go hundreds of feet into the pipe, so they can be utilized to scope the main line. The camera will send out a signal when it finds the clog, informing the inspector the exact area.

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine passes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
