<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I love to prepare, I generate a great deal of meals. We established a temporary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we realized that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the home within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will stay clog-free for 1 month. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely happy that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company once again and again in the future.</p>
