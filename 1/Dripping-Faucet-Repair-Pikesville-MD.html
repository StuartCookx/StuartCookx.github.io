The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to leave. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down lead to a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
