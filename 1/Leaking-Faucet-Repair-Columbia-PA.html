Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear. A tankless hot water heater system in your house provides greater energy performance and additional cost-savings each month. They're a smart financial investment, but like with any system, a tankless hot water heater may need periodic repairs. You can minimize the need for repairs, however, by opting for professional installation. Have an experienced hand tackle the job.</p>

If your home was built prior to the 1970s, we highly recommend that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. Possibilities are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at ideal rates if your house was built years before that.</p>
