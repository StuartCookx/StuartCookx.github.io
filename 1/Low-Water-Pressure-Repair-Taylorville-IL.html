Even basic gas leakage requires gas line repair in Richmond, which alone can lead to expensive expenditure. The typical cost of a house inspection nationwide is in between $244 and $421. A basic house inspection typically includes an examination of your plumbing and water heater, but not necessarily your sewer or sewer lines. A sewer camera inspection will be an add-on to your whole house inspection. It is also often an extra cost for a plumbing inspection.</p>
