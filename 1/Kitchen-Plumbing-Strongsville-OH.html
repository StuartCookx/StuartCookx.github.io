An authorized, properly installed and maintained backflow assembly essentially removes the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter life-span than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity.

Understanding the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
