<p>Natural Gas and lp that comes out of the ground is completely odor-free. The egg smell connected with gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you ought to require to safeguard yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
