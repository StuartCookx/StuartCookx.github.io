<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener requires to drain the diminished salt water service after the regeneration cycle. Secure the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain tubes need to have an air gap. Completion of the hose be at least 2 inches above the dedicated drain. An air space may be used to achieve this, and may be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
<p>It's also a good concept to have your toilet inspected if it was produced prior to 1994, as older toilets are normally much less effective than more recent designs. You could be wasting hundreds of gallons of water and hundreds of dollars on an inefficient toilet.

PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are excellent alternatives to the pricey copper piping.</p>
