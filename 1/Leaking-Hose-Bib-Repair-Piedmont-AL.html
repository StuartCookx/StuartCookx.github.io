<p>Sinkholes don't just take place in your lawn, sadly, when a sewer line breaks. If there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your house's foundation, the best you can hope for is to discover quickly.

Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in locations where water sits for long periods of time.

Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas water heaters with unique venting systems likewise are readily available. However they're harder to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
