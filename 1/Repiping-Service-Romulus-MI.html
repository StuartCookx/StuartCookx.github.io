When the disposal gets jammed to avoid damaging the motor, a red button at the bottom of the system trips. First, unplug the disposal, then press the red button to remove the jam.</p>
<p>Note: Copper piping in the Florida area is especially vulnerable to recurring pinhole leakages (deterioration that breaks through the surface of piping), so watch out for bluish-greenish corrosion on copper piping. Auto-reverse setting: Some waste disposal unit come with this setting, which reverses the instructions the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't break as quickly. All leakages, broken fittings, and other plumbing problems will be dealt with.</p>
