<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water. Most water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank.

The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>

<p>Some producers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself.
