<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to remove tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical process called Design template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not stay with any surface area in your home, keeping your devices and warm water heaters without hard water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners because they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it.
