<p>Your first step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). Check the directions if your valve is a various design from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

These are all signs that your unit ought to be inspected by a plumber.

You should likewise prevent utilizing any kind of chemical drain cleaners on your waste disposal unit because these chemicals will just damage the device further.</p>
