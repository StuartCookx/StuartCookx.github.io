Old age: If your hot water heater isn't working like it utilized to and it is at or above 10-15 years of age, it might be time to replace your system.

They can also lower the energy required for houses with far greater requirements as well. Homes that use over 80 gallons of hot water every day can save as much as 14% by switching to these smaller sized water heaters. It is estimated that an average household can conserve as much as $100 each year by switching to the tankless heater.</p>
<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 usually depending upon the length from the main gas line. Setting up a gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the yard costs $300 to $1,400.
