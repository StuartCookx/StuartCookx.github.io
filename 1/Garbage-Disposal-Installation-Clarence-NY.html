Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water actually requires it. Newer systems utilize electronic sensing units that keep track of bead exhaustion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regrow when required. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect because they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
