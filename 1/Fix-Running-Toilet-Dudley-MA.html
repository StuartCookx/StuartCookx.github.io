<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
