Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to get away.

It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard versus back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
<p>In community water system systems, water is normally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream to and out of the plumbing components in your house or company.

To prevent such an incident, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention method made use of. The best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture).

Getting rid of the backflow preventer to repair it is not essential in most cases. Some parts such as relief valve bodies might need to be eliminated from the main body to help with a repair. Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
