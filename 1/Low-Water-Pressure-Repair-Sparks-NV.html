However, it generally does not consist of shutoff valves, may or may not be equipped with test cocks or ports, and is generally less reliable than a DC.

<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design).

This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
