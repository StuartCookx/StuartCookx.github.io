Galvanized steel pipes need to be eliminated by a professional plumber when discovered and changed with another pipe product. Sump and sedimentation manholes separate the stormwater from sanitary water, decreasing the volume and cost of treatment. Culvert repair diverts storm run-off and lessens erosion and run-off. Shoring supports trench walls and safeguards staff members from cave-ins. Shoring also supports exposed utilities until the ground is restored.</p>
