<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Westwood MA</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its lots of designated usages around your home.</p>
