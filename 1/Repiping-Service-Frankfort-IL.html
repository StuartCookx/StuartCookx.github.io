<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Frankfort IL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
