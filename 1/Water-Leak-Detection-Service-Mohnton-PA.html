<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need an unique garbage disposal. The system should grind the waste even finer to prevent clogs and allow the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but should then transition to galvanized. I am uncertain why that must be. It is also permitted to use black iron if it is probably covered with a galvanized covering (which is basically an unique paint"). PG&E often does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
<p>There are two popular install systems utilized for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt install (if you've had a disposer set up for some time, it's probably mounted this way) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock"). Each accomplish the same task with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name suggests, the EZ Mount mechanism is intended to be simpler to handle when repairing a system or installing.</p>
