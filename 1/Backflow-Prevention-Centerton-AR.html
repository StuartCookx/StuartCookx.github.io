<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
