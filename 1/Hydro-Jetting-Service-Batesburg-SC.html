We have all the parts needed to fix your toilet. If we have to order them, it just takes a brief time. Toilets are typically neglected, but they are among the most important components in a home.

<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style).

This process continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regrowed.</p>
