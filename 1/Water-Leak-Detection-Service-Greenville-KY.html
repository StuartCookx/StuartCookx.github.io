<p>The waste disposal unit is humming, but not turning. The garbage disposal has become jammed. IF IT IS JAMMED, NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL. Even if the system is off, the blades are sharp and dangerous. Make certain the unit is off, you can even switch off the breaker to make sure it can't be switched on by mishap. Your garbage disposal includes a. hex wrench that can be used to place into the opening situated at the bottom of the system. If you can't find this wrench, then attempt to insert a broom manage or plunger into the sink drain opening and try to turn the jammed flywheel.
