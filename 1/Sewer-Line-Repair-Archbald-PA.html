<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an event such as a water main break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire combating, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release until the supply side pressure again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
