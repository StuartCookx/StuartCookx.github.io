<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger.

When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.
