<p>Our suggestion: Generally you'll wish to go with PEX pipes not just due to the fact that they are economical, however because they're reliable and simple to install.

Connect the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the mounting ring to the flange from beneath the sink. Make sure you snap the backup ring in location.

If he or she pressures you to work with quickly and pay cash up front, never hire someone who comes unsolicited to your door and can't provide you evidence of certifications-- specifically.
