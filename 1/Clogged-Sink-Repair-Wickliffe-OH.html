<p>If your polybutylene pipes have failed, read your insurance coverage thoroughly. Ensure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Lots of insurance provider will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims may be rejected because the basic HO-3 house owners' policy specifically omits "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged time period." Call your insurance coverage representative and confirm your protection. As soon as you have actually reviewed your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered, check with your representative to verify that your understanding is correct.</p>
<p>In addition to the specific centers noted above, an authorized backflow prevention assembly must be installed on each safe and clean water service connection to any premises consisting of a potential or actual danger. Listed below are examples of threats and the minimum protection required to be installed for each kind of risk. The minimum accepted backflow prevention assembly for unlisted risks will be identified on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
