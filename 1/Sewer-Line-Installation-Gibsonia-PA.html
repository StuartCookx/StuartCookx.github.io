Backflow is the undesirable flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, gasses or substances into the drinking supply of water. In the majority of states, other than Kansas, you are responsible for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your home or organisation. Atmos Energy does not maintain the gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other utilities, such as your electrical wiring and water pipes.</p>

At this time, we do not expect any disturbances or impact to our services as a result of the break out. There are two fundamental kinds of toilet flushing systems; both types conserve water by utilizing 1.6 gallons of water per flush.

<p>2. Potassium Pellets can be used as a sodium replacement and is advised for those who are enjoying their salt intake. Potassium pellets work with any water softener and can be bought at a number of the very same shops where salt pellets are sold for about the same cost. Sometimes, a gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. If a contractor is working on a person's landscaping and inadvertently burst a line, this type of situation might happen. A house owner's policy may cover this kind of repair. In addition, if a rupture is created by an energy company, it might be covered.</p>
<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the common reasons for gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances take place most commonly in the winter season. Since houses are not adequately aerated during the cooler months to avoid heat loss, this is. If you haven't done so currently, we suggest installing carbon monoxide gas detectors outside of bedroom doors to notify you of any prospective gas leaks.</p>
