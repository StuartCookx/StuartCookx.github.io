<p>Leaks are sneaky. While the time needed will differ based on your home size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to reserve as much as two hours when you schedule an inspection. There's constantly the opportunity that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the starting time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next visit, they likely rushed the task (unless you have a really small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to arrange your appointment.</p>

This might hold true sometimes, however most of the time you will save yourself difficulty, time and money if you call a skilled plumber when you don't understand anything about toilet repair.</p>
