<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be gotten rid of by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin.

<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
