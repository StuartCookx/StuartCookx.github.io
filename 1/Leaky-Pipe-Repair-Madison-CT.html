<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
