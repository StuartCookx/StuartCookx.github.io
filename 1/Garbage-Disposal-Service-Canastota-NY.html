<p>. The size of the population likewise impacts water demand. According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The median per capita water use per day is greater in rural counties than city counties in all the climate regions, other than in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with backwoods having less efficient water system systems2 primarily due to the relative lack of funds to update and keep their systems.
