I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate.
