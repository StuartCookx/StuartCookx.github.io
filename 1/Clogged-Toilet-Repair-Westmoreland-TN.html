Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
