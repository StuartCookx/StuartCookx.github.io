<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Without a water softener, laundry demands additional cleaning agent to avoid it from looking dingy. Dishes will come out of your dishwasher spotted and stained. Filmy scum develops on your shower curtains and your soap and shampoo will not lather. Bathing in tough water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair lifeless and sticky. The sheer amount of energy, time, and money needed to tidy up the harmful adverse effects of difficult water is excessive. An entire house water softener is the service to the scourge of water solidity.</p>
