<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Stuart VA</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
