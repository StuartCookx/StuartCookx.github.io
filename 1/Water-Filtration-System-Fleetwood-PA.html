It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.
