If you reside in a cold-weather environment, we extremely recommend repiping your house throughout spring or summer so you do not need to worry about freezing temperature levels throughout the repiping procedure.

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked annually. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated annually to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
