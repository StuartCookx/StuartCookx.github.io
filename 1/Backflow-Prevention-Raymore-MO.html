<p>There are a couple of types of hot water heater to pick from, each design has its downsides and benefits. The best one for you depends on just how much hot water you use, and the heating technique (electrical energy, gas, oil). Some claim to lower energy expenses by up to 50 percent of traditional storage models. The trade-off is that the initial expenses are greater and your return on investment will take longer. CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is among the most common types of plastic piping utilized in plumbing systems today.

A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention security. The 2nd type is a damp standpipe system which is usually connected to the structures potable water system and requires the installation of a check valve assembly.</p>
