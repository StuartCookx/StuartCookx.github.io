<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that must likewise be well maintained to assist prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and split or just be so squished that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever remains in great shape.</p>
