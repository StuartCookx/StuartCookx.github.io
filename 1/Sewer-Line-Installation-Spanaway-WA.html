<p>You'll need an unique garbage disposal if you home uses a septic system and drain field. The system needs to grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but should then shift to galvanized. I am not sure why that need to be. It is also allowed to utilize black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized finishing (which is essentially an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E typically does this.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to corrode and burst when they get old.

The proposal might be thought about and approved, if it fulfills the intent of the plumbing code.</p>
