<p>The garbage disposal as we know it today was initially offered to Americans in the mid-1930s. The systems exploded in popularity during the 1940s through word-of-mouth. Today, it's estimated that over 50% of American homes have a garbage disposal in their kitchen. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus uses you an optional Pipe Defense Plan for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily accessible, gas pipes running from the gas meter to your natural gas devices.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Gas lines undoubtedly need repairs-- age and use will ultimately use them down.

That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections ensure you understand every possible gas line issue, and our repairs make certain your system is working perfectly again.</p>

The results of a malfunctioning toilet vary greatly-- from the moderate inconvenience of a tank that won't stop running to the unhygienic and possibly dreadful back-up of unflushed sewage. No matter how big or small your toilet problems might be, Four Seasons Plumbing is here to assist!
