<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
