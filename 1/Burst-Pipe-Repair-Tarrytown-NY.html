<p>Salt-free systems will also lower scale accumulation and offer brighter clothes and softer skin utilizing a much healthier method. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without needing to add salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Standard salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative result on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and utilize no drainage, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last as much as 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a monthly basis.</p>
