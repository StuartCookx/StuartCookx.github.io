More recent units utilize digital sensors that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other crucial metrics based upon your water use and for that reason only regrow when required. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
