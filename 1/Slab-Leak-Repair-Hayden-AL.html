<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Hayden AL</h3>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
