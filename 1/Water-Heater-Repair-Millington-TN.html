<p>A couple of local authorities require that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the luxury of the irrigated area. It might not be installed in any location where it might ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not enable the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
