The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task.

Knowing the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
