There are 2 main kinds of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Double check valve assembly (DCV) and lowered pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most commonly utilized in commercial centers.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
