<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
