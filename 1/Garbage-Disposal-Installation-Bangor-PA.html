<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it hard to get to in-wall pipes, think about at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, replacing exposed pipes in a utility, crawlspace, or basement room is fairly simple, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>

If the smoke does not draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Turn off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to fix the issue.</p>
