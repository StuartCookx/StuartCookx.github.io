<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
