As rust and minerals build up with time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems.

As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and split or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place.
