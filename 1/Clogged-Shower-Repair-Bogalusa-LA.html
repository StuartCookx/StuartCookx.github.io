<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
