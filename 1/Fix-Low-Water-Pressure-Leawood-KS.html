<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" facilities.</p>
