<p>When purchasing a new home, it's important to make sure the dependability of your drain and sewer lines. Most plumbing is hidden behind walls and underground. ZOOM DRAIN ® can perform a detailed video inspection of your drainage system utilizing advanced camera inspection devices specifically designed to identify any problems within your new property's main drain line.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
