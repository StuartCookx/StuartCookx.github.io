Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer.

<p>She learnt about the service call cost. The 4 In Your Corner Investigation found that's a common charge. Customer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would provide a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the situation before devoting to a cost, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
