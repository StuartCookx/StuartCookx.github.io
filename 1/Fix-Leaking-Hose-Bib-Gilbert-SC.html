<p>Just like kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, shower, or bathtub) can be fixed easily if the clog is shallow and easy. For the majority of obstructions you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, but if this doesn't solve the problem then you might also need to call in a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>

These chemicals are easy to use and inexpensive, however they damage your pipes and their impacts are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize extreme chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
