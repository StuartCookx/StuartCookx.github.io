After a minute, move a smoking cigarettes match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke needs to be prepared the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke doesn't draw. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem.</p>
