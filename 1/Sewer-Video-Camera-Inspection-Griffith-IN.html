<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Camera are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention test packages and repair parts are a should for the passionate do-it-yourselfer. Our backflow test sets work with all reduced pressure principle, double check valve, spill resistant, and pressure vacuum breaker type backflow preventers. All our packages are compact and portable, and come with the necessary determines, pipes, and adapter fittings. Note: The Planning & Advancement Department can not release a list of authorized backflow prevention assemblies, which is readily available to USC members only.
