<p>Watering backflow devices are created for installation on safe and clean water lines to safeguard versus both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the potable water supply. While there's not a specific schedule regarding when you must repipe your home, you must certainly check out repiping if they haven't been performed in 50 years or more-- specifically if you live in an older home developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather.
