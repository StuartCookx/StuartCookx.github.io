<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services Blanchester OH</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
