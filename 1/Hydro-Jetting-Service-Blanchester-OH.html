A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
