As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
