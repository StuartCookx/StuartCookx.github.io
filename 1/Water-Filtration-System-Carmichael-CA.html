Lots of obstructions are caused by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Be aware of just how much bathroom tissue your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush.

This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
