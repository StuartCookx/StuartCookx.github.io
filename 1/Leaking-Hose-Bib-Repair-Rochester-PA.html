<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
