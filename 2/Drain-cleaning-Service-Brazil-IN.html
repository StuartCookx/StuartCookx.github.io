When you need to replace old, damaged pipes. Is your water bad or foul-smelling tasting? Is the water from your cold water tap warmer than you want to drink?

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly kept for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
