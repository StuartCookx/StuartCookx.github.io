<p>Lubrication may help with the positioning of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the professional put together the elements into the body without producing damage from friction. The lubricant should be a food grade lubricant to ensure the water supply is not infected. In most cases the best lube is water. The normal usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently oiled to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out faster by bring in dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the element. The correct amount of lube need to make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You should never see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>
