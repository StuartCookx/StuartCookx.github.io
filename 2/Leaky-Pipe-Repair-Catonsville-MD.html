<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and split or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
