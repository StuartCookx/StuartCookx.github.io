<p>Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is completely odor-free. The egg odor related to gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you need to require to secure yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
