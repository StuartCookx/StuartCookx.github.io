<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the luxury of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any place where it might ever be submerged under water. Some municipalities do not permit the use of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some don't allow the use of a PVB at all, so contact your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it must be set up in a place where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
<p>Anything that goes down returns up once again - This is the second most common indication that your drains are clogged.
