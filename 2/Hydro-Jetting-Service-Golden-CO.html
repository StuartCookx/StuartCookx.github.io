<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it challenging to access to in-wall pipes, think about at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, replacing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, basement, or energy  room is relatively straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets should absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
