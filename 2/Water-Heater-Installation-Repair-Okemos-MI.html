<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
