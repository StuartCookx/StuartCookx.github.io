Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>
