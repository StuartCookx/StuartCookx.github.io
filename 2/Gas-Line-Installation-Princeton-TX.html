The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to leave. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down lead to a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
