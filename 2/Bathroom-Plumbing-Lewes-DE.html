Although your garbage disposal often goes undetected in your kitchen it can really trigger problems when it stops working or gets clogged. Check to make certain it's not your garbage disposal that's causing the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then check it to make certain it's running correctly. If the disposal has actually overheated, you may need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the system beneath the sink.</p>

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
