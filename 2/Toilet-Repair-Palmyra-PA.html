<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regeneration depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water in fact needs it. More recent units use digital sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other key metrics based upon your water use and therefore just regrow when required. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect because they save energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
