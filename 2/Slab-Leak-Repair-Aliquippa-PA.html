<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is required to get rid of the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simplicity of its design and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be not practical in many scenarios to install a pipe segment of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
