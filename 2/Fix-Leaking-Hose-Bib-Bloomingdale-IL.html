<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
