<p>In a watering system, backflow has 2 causes: back siphonage or back pressure. Practically all components on a water heater can be fixed or replaced other than for the tank itself. When the tank rusts through, there is no way to repair it; replacement is the only service. Turn the garbage disposal over and remove electrical cover plate. Pull out wires. Insert cable television adapter (not consisted of) and run electrical cable through access hole on bottom of waste disposal unit. Tighten cable connector. Push wires into garbage disposal (do not displace cardboard shield) and replace electrical cover plate.</p>
