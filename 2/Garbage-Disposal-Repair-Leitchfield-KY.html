<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away.
