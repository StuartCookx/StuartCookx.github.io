<p>Tree roots can be a significant factor in impacted sewer lines. Tree roots grow in several directions and can get very large causing invasion of the lines underground.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly stored for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
