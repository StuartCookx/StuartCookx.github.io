<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
