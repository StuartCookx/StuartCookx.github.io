Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
