<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter was featured in the SyFy tv program Ghost Hunters (2004-2016) as the two founders of TAPS work for Roto-Rooter as plumbers in the company's Providence, Rhode Island branch. There are sectors featuring Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson working as plumbing technicians in their day tasks at Roto-Rooter in between paranormal investigations on the show.

<p>Water heater repair can sometimes be cost-prohibitive. You'll spend for the essential repairs only to deal with another problem quickly afterwards. Always continue to run water during and after utilizing your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
