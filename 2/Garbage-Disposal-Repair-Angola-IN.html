For each device, the cost can vary from a base of $7,500 to $15,000 for midsize buildings and $15,000 to $35,000 for larger structures; this does not consist of the PE's or RA's style fees. The DEP filing charge is $350 per service connection and the DOB filing cost is a little over 1% of the approximated plumbing cost. The size of the device is also a factor in cost.
