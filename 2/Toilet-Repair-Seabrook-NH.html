<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
