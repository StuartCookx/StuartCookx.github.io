<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is required to get rid of the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be impractical in numerous circumstances to install a pipe section of this length. In addition, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
