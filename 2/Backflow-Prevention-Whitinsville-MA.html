<p>Blockages are easily prevented with a couple of essential actions. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers capture hair, food and other particles before it gets stuck, avoiding the need of drain cleaning. Although they do not catch whatever, it assists the system considerably. Installing a tankless water heater is a greater upfront investment, however these systems can substantially cut the cost of monthly utilities. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of warm water, on-demand tankless systems can save between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>In this approach, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated. Quick heating gas heaters, as a general guideline, will heat up water far much faster than an electrical water heater of the same basic measurements and capacity. An electrical hot water heater may take a full hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might warm two times that amount in the same given time and possibly faster.</p>
