If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two telltale signs of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet.

It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to take place, so by the time you see it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
