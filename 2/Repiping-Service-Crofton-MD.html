This is particularly true when the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
