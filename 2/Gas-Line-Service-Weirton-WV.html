They may develop smells if too much food is left inside of them for too long, and some less expensive models are also prone to leaks. Some designs may also be loud, while other models are not indicated to be utilized with specific sinks or with septic systems, indicating that there is often a high knowing curve associated with selecting the right model.</p>
<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6).

If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). If your valve is a various design from the one we show, examine the directions.
