We've currently seen what these two terms have in common, so what's the distinction between them? When it concerns the concern of difficult water, a standard water softener actually removes calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is called momentary hardness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
