<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Barnesville OH</h3>
<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its typical flow. IRWD's safe and clean water system is developed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "normal," the direction of water circulation can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the potential for contaminated water getting in the safe and clean water circulation system. Copper is a biostatic product, which suggests bacteria will not grow on it. Copper has been used (together with PVC pipes) since the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings. It is especially helpful for cold and hot tap water and refrigerant lines in A/C systems.</p>

Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are properly evaluated by qualified workers.</p>
