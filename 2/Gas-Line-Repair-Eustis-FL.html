<p>When the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>

Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
