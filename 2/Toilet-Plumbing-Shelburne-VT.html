<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Dual flush valves are becoming increasingly more common, as both consumers and makers look for brand-new ways to save water. Double flush toilets allow the user to select the level of water required to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is strong or liquid. We've all heard the old saying, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, lots of people find that squicky - therefore the double flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're simply utilizing less water to do it.</p>
<p>Consult your backflow prevention assembly producer or the item spec sheets to verify that the assembly is USC-approved You need to also validate the assembly is approved in the orientation for which it is being set up (horizontal, vertical, and so on).
