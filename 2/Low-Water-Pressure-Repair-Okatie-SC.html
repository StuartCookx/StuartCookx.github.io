<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Okatie SC</h3>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
