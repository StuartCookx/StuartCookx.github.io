<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is required to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simpleness of its style and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be not practical in lots of situations to install a pipe section of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
