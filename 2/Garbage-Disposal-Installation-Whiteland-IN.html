Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
