If this takes place just when your warm water is running, it may be because of a corroded warm water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your home.</p>
<p>Water softeners come in all sizes and shapes and bigger absolutely does not imply better. WaterBoss ® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller beads that really offer more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to allow optimal capacity in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system helps guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also secure the resin bed, so we do not need to lose space on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regeneration to release firmness, sediment and dirt.</p>
