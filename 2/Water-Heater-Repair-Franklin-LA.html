<p>Lubrication may aid with the placement of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly.

All 'rings ought to be gently oiled to guarantee they do not present of their retainer. The use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to use or stop working out earlier by attracting dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the element.

This is a good indication that your pipes might be rusting from the within and therefore, need to be changed. Remember that if the rust-colored water just comes with warm water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
