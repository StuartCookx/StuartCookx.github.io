<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from regular circulation instructions within a piping system as the result of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure. This reduction in supply pressure takes place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water mains). Garbage disposal warranties last approximately 5 years, but they can vary in between 2 and 10 years. Because the average life-span of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you might want to acquire a prolonged service warranty.

To prevent more malfunctions, property owners need to keep up with routine maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
