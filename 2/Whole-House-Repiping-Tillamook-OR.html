How typically a toilet blockages depends upon the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush. If your toilet blocks more than once a month-or even when a week!- it's probably since mineral deposits have built up around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>

Even though other valves will look different, the clearing process is comparable. However, you may have to remove a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to get rid of the cap.</p>
