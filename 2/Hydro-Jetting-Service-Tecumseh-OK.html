It typically signifies rust and mineral accumulation if you discover low water pressure or tarnished water. As rust and minerals build up over time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, impacting the water quality.

A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again surpasses the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
