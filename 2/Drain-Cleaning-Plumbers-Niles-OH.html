<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Niles OH</h3>
<p>Close all exterior windows and doors and switch on your kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans. Then open a nearby warm water faucet up until you hear the burner in the hot water heater fire up. After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke should be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke does not draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Shut off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the issue.</p>
<p>If you spot a leak and choose a patching job instead of a repiping job, just remember that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the very same material and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole home when you identify a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
