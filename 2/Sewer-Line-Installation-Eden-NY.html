<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
