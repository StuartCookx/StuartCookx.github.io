<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of utilize the method set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee. This is especially real when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
