<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the approach laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. This is specifically real when the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
