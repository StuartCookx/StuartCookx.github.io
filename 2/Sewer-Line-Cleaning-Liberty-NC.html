<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the outside. An RPZ will regularly discharge percentages of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and enable appropriate drainage.</p>
