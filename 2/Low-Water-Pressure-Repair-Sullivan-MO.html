When thinking about the well being of your San Antonio water heater, here are some things to look for. The biggest drain on your residential or commercial property is your sewer line.

<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regrowed, the beads become filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Tough water causes white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these signs.</p>
