<p>Search for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Because pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>

Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the dingy gray triggered by tough water. Please send our thanks to all included with testing, fixing, changing and servicing our softener.
