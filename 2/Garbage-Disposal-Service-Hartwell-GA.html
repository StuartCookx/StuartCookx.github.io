<h3>Water Softener Repair in Hartwell Georgia</h2>
<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
