<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the start of our house improvements. George and Anthony did a fantastic task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our house. I will always use them and request for George particularly for all future issues or repairs. They were timely and provided very good pricing for what we required done. I highly recommend this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be gotten rid of by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are available if the resin has actually currently been fouled. Once again, it is recommended to inspect the maker's guidelines for special safety measures.</p>
