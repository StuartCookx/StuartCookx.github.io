<p>Those people in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in lots of areas have greatly lowered the variety of reported events that occur within our water systems. This has at times led to people believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever actually have been a concern in the first location. This thinking can be both counterproductive and harmful. Backflow incidents in water supply are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a lowered pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or absolutely nothing technique to backflow defense. We need to take a look at each installation for the threat it presents and after that install the proper defense.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high risk" facilities.</p>
