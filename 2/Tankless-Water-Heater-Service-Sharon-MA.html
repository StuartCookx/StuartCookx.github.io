<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are captured and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any remaining pollutants.</p>
<p>Low Hazards: For low hazards including fire systems and irrigation systems, City of Bellingham accepts double check detector and double check valve assemblies, pressure vacuum breaker assemblies and atmospheric vacuum breakers as types of security.
