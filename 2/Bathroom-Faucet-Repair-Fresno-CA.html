Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and outstanding alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is completely saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and imperfections. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes. Once the process is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be checked one more time to ensure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
