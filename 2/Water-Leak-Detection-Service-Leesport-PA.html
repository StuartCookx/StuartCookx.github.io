<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that must likewise be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to split and harden or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything remains in good shape.</p>
