<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.
