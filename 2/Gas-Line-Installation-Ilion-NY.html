<p>In community water supply systems, water is usually kept at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or service. When the pressure drops for some factor such as might happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to combat a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation happens, infected water may be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention method utilized. The best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air space is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is needed. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water supplier.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an event such as a water main break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire battling, causes the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
