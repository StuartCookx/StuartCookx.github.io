The system chosen for a given installation must be suitable for the system design and website conditions, including consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is likely to happen. Further, it should be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, maker specs, and engineering standards for the type of system to be utilized.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
