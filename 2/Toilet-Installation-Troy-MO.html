<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct impact on your security, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. Your water is brown or red. Some types of pipes can rust over time. This rust will break off into your house's water supply and can turn your tap water a reddish or brown  color. In this case, repiping your home is needed since not just are your pipes old, but your water quality is impacted as well. When you purchase a new disposal, package will include all the parts you need to install it. Before you jump into eliminating the old system, take a couple of moments to familiarize yourself with all these parts. Put them together in the correct order and try out the locking mechanism.

The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you water with safe and clean water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, potable and irrigation, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
