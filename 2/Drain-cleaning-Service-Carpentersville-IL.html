Subsequently residential licenses provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before operating the irrigation system.

<p>Cured-in place piping is a technique used to repair trenchless relining systems. Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter have the ability to from another location line the area of the pipe that is split without having to dig a trench. After the interior of the pipe is cleaned and dried, the installers will use the lining to the problem area. The liner is treated in place with jets of hot steam as it molds into all the fractures inside the pipe.</p>

<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
