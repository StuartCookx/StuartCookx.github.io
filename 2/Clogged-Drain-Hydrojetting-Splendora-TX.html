<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
