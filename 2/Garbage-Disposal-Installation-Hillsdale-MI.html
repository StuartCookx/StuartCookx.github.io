<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily saved for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
