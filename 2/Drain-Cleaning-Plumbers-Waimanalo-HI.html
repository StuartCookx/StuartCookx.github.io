Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry.

While those cost savings are still considerable, brand-new commercial softening innovation using multi-tank systems (MTS) likewise offers considerable water and salt savings.</p>
<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to business? The timing of regeneration depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water actually needs it. When needed, newer units use computerized sensors that keep an eye on bead depletion and other key metrics based on your water use and for that reason just restore. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal since they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
