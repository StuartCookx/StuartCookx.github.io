<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks beverages. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

<p>Obstructions are quickly prevented with a few essential actions. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers capture hair, food and other debris before it gets stuck, avoiding the need of drain cleaning. Although they do not capture whatever, it assists the system substantially. Setting up a tankless water heater is a higher upfront investment, however these units can significantly cut the cost of regular monthly energies. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes utilizing 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank water heaters.</p>
<p>Once the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
