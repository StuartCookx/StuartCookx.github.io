<p>As water heaters age, especially when they approach the decade mark, you may start to see some issues. Any types of unusual sounds normally suggest trouble. Popping noises, for example, show that the water is boiling (which should never ever happen). Sediment build-up or a defective thermostat represent typical factors for boiling water. Water naturally consists of the minerals that can contribute to problems with a water heater, and locations with tough water might need more regular flushes or service.</p>
<p>The term hard water describes water with a high mineral material. These minerals can differ depending upon which area of the nation you remain in, but many commonly consist of calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates. Tough water does not start out hard-- rather, it picks up mineral deposits as it can be found in contact with limestone underground.
