<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to get to in-wall pipes, consider at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, replacing exposed pipes in a energy, crawlspace, or basement room is fairly simple, since the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>

<p>An atmospheric pressure test is required. The test pressure shall be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, however no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test duration will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall withstand the test pressure defined without showing any proof of leakage or other flaws. Mechanical gauges used to measure test pressures shall have a variety such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than five times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will require an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be carried out using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection.
