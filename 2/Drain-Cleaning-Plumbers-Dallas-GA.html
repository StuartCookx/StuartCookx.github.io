<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>
