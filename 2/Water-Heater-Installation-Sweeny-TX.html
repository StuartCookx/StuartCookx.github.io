<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
