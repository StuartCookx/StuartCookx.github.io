A repair service will help determine whether this is the case.</p>

When turned on the motor spins and impellers-- also called lugs-- throw little bits of food against a grinder ring.

To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention method made use of. The very best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The correct backflow prevention device is required if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
