<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different style from the one we show, examine the instructions.
