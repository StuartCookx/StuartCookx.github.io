Galvanized steel pipes need to be eliminated by a professional plumber when found and changed with another pipe product. Sump and sedimentation manholes separate the stormwater from sanitary water, decreasing the volume and cost of treatment. Culvert repair diverts storm run-off and decreases disintegration and run-off. Shoring stabilizes trench walls and protects workers from cave-ins.

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
