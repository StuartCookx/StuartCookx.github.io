<p>If you identify a leak and opt for a patching job rather of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the very same product and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to consider repiping your entire house when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
