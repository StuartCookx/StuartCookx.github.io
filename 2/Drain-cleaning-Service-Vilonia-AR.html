Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>

The beads end up being complete of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed. As difficult water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions.
