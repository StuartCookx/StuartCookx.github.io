<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that go back to service. Because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
