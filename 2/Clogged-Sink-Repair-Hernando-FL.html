<p>The US Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, next to cooling and heating. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.

<p>When you turn your irrigation system on, it's a great idea to check your backflow assembly every spring. However, we rarely advise CPVC when a whole home requirements repiping.

Licensing generally requires an examination or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for more details.</p>
<p>Repiping is performed by specialists who are specially trained and complete most houses in 1-2 days. Throughout a repipe, not every room will be associated with the building. Typically at least one bathroom will be made available for usage over night. A repipe requires a license from the city and an inspection to ensure compliance with building regulations. During the repipe, holes are made in walls to install the brand-new piping. These holes are covered following the installation.</p>
