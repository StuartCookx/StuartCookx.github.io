<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water conserves you money. A clogged kitchen sink is usually an indication of an obstruction in the plumbing system. If the obstruction isn't removed, water pressure can develop within the pipe, eventually causing it to burst.
