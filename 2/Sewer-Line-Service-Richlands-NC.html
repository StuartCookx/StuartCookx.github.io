Roto-Rooter's expert plumbers provide a complete variety of basement plumbing services and drain cleaning services, however basement floor drain cleaning is one of the most typical. To prep your system for installation, you may need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug package that I bought individually from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case. You might need to check out using a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
