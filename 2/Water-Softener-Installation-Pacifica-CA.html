An efficient softener can decrease annual cleaning agent costs by more than $6,000. Many company owner presume that due to the fact that they have a softener set up, they are currently recognizing these cost savings. But, that is not always the case.

A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). Check the instructions if your valve is a different style from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
