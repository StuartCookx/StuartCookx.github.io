There are numerous kinds of piping systems and conditions, it's a great concept to get an entire house plumbing inspection in addition to a water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the method set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior size of the tee. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
