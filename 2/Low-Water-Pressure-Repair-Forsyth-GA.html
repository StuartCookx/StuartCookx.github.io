<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) needs plumbing contractors to get a plumbing authorization before setting up or changing a backflow preventer. Your hot water heater. The pro will next inspect your hot water heater. With your water heater, he or she is looking at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ). Some will likewise flush your water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance task that avoids tough water and sediment accumulation. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to rinse out any buildup.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
