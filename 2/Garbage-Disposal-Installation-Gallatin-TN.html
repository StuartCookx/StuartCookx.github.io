After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>

<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
