<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
