<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>

<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions.
