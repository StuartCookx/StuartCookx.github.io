<p>Leakages can happen if the seal in between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain stops working.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
