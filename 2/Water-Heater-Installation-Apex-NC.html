<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we reveal, inspect the instructions. After installing the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, ensure the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
