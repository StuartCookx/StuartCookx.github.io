<p>Trees and shrubs are a common cause of sewer clogs to the house. Roots can turn into the tiniest crack or gap in your house's drain pipe, where they flourish in the nutrient rich environment offered by the sewer. Flat roofs generally have actually drains spaced out around their perimeter. The drains are connected to vertical pipes that are generally linked to underground horizontal pipes connected to municipal storm sewers. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to bring back circulation and prevent water collection on top of the structure's roofing system.</p>
<p>Often a waste disposal unit simply stops to work and you can't find out the cause. Garbage disposal problems can be attributed to a range of possible problems.
