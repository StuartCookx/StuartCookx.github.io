<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, but these will be identified to that impact. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
<p>Stainless-steel blades are usually chosen due to the fact that they're less prone to rust. Other excellent options are overload security, which turns off the motor if it begins to overheat; an auto-reverse function to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the unclean dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal specifically created to be used with a septic system. gives a summary 1 of garbage disposals and septic tanks.</p>
