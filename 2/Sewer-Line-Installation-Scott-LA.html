<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about totally regenerated.</p>
