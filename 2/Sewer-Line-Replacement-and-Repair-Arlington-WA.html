In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any remaining pollutants.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested every year to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
