<p>Pipeline leak detection is utilized to identify if and in some cases where a leak has actually occurred in systems which contain gases and liquids. Many plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices typically get 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, along with some technical direction, each year. Technical direction consists of security, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and services. A lot of apprentices go into a program directly, but some begin as assistants or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
