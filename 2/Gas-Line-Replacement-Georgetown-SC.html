You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're uncertain if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Water softeners typically utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from dissolved sodium chloride salt, likewise called salt water. In the ion exchange procedure, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble wet sand.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
