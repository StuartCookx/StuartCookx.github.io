<p>There are different products used in re-piping, in water supply re-piping some of the products are metal and possibly some plastic pipes. The metal pipes are galvanized steel or brass, copper, and iron. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec. The majority of these plastic pipe systems will end in lawsuits. Part of the problem is with the fittings that are often cheaply made with little quality control by a verity of abroad companies. Plastic pipes also have questionable signing up with approaches. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and result in water damage.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly.
