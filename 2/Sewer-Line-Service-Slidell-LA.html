<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman thought the price she spent for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way could have conserved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure.

When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
