<p>Our procedure begins with an inspection of the numerous problems faced by the homeowner, this is followed by among our substantial group of professionals inserting a camera into the drains to determine the blocked area and identify how best to proceed.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
