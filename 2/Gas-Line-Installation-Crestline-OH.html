<p>Cured-in place piping is a technique used to repair trenchless relining systems. Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter are able to remotely line the area of the pipe that is cracked without having to dig a trench. After the interior of the pipe is cleaned and dried, the installers will use the lining to the issue area. The liner is cured in place with jets of hot steam as it molds into all the cracks inside the pipe.</p>

Backflow can happen in a variety of circumstances that might draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
