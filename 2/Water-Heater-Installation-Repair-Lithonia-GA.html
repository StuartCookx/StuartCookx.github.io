<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Lithonia GA</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>With drain line cleaning, you know your pipes are sparkly clean. With repairs, you understand they're in good condition. And with lining, you understand they'll be safe and secure for years to come. As a house owner or entrepreneur, those peace of minds can be really, very good to hear.
