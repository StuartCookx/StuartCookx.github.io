If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you need to take to protect yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that need to also be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to break and solidify or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location.

Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
