<p>Do you need a replacement for an older unit that's ended up being problematic, or simply for a make over? How about for a building addition or major remodel? Once once again, that's something you might do yourself, although it's normally better to employ a knowledgeable sink plumber in the San Diego area. Installation involves over a lots actions, and getting rid of the old one involves even more operations. It can be difficult matching up cut outs and fixture holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with whatever sealed up.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>

Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever remains in great shape.</p>
