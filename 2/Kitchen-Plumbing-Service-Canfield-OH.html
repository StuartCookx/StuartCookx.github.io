<p>Close all exterior doors and windows and switch on your kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans. Then open a close-by hot water faucet until you hear the gas burner in the water heater ignite.

If the smoke doesn't draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Switch off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the issue.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
