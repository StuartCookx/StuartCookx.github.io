Technical direction consists of security, local plumbing codes and regulations, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and businesses. Many apprentices enter a program directly, however some start as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
