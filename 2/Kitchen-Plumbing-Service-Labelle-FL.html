Prior to salt begins working in a water softener it needs a little residence time within the tank, because the salt is liquifying slowly. When one right away starts regeneration after adding salt to the tank, the water softener might not work according to standards. After an approval of strategies has been provided and the assembly has been installed, it needs to be checked by a certified tester. The designer (or water supplier) is then accountable to certify that the installation was carried out in accordance with approved strategies; or explain any changes or submit "As Developed" plans as appropriate.</p>
