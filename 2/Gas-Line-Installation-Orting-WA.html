<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Orting WA</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
