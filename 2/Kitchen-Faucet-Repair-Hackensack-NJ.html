<p>Lubrication may assist with the positioning of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the service technician put together the components into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lubricant to assure the water system is not contaminated. Oftentimes the very best lube is water. The usual use for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be lightly oiled to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using too much lubricant can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out sooner by drawing in dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the element. The proper amount of lubricant ought to make the surface area of the 'ring appear damp. You must never see pieces or globs of lubricant.</p>

This location often experiences leakages too. This might be due to a backup of clogged sewage that cant get to the main sewer lines.</p>
<p>Although the specialist concurred that the customer did the best thing in her efforts to tighten the pipes, the technician saw that the pipe had ended up being incredibly corroded throughout the years which a PVC pipe might be better matched for the client's needs. He switched off the water supply to the house, eliminated the rusty system and fit a PVC pipe in its location. Before leaving the house, the professional restored water flow and evaluated the pipe.</p>
