Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things differently could have saved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of disposals: batch feed and continuous feed. Most houses use constant feed disposals, which implies the disposal will work as long as it is switched on. This is handy when a lot of work is to be performed in the kitchen. Batch disposals have a holding tank that accumulates waste till it is full and is then activated when the lid is closed. Our plumbers can help you choose which type of disposal will work best for your sink.</p>
