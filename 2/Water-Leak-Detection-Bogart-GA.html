<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
