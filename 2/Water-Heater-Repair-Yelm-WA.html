<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
