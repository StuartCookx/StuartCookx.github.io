Technical direction includes safety, local plumbing codes and regulations, and plan reading. Apprentices likewise study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and services. Most apprentices go into a program straight, but some start as helpers or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
