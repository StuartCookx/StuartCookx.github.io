You need to invest a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a durable finish and a reliable stopper mechanism. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be frustrating. The twist-and-drop design is much easier to utilize but requires periodic -ring replacement.</p>
