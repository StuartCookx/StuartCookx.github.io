<p>Searching for timely Albuquerque emergency plumbing services? The 3rd main component of a water softening system is the brine tank. The salt water tank is generally a storage tank for sodium chloride (NaCl) or potassium chloride (KCL) which is blended with water throughout the salt water refill and regrowth cycles. This brine (a focused solution of seawater) is drawn back into the mineral tank throughout the regrowth phase to renew the softener bed. The salt or potassium chloride is a sacrificial media and must be renewed on a regular basis to make sure appropriate softening form the device.</p>
<p>The procedure of regeneration can utilize 25 gallons of water or more per day, or approximately 10,000 gallons annually.
