I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole.
