<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
