<p>When the information gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has actually broken down in its performance listed below the established minimum basic, backflow preventers need to just be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer.

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
