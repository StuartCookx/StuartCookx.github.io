<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
