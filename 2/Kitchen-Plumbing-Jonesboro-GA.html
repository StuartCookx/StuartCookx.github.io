<p>When the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
