<p>Leaks are tricky. While the time needed will differ based on the house size and the number of found breakdowns, it's best to set aside as much as 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's constantly the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and postpone the starting time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a very small plumbing system).

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close.
