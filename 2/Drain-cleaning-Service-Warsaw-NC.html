<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
