<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Conshohocken PA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
