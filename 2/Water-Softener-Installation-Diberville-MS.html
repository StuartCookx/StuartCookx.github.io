<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of 6 State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is likewise serves as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Strategy Inspector for the group. The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, changing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or utility  room is relatively simple, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets ought to definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they slowly start to constrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure.

Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, impacting your water quality.</p>
