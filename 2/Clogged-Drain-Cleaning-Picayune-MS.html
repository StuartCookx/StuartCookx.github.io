<p>Physical damage: If you observe any physical damage to the unit, it may be time for a professional hot water heater replacement. Leaks, damages, and cracks can contribute to water damage or electrical failures. Properties with water wells: Properties on well water must have an RP backflow preventer on their service line isolating the general public water supply from the residential or commercial property.
