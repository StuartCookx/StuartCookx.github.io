<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Purcell OK</h3>

That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines ought to be covered.

When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E typically does this.</p>

Toilet continues to run - Either fill device has stopped working to shutoff or runs out adjustment sending water into the bowl. Toilet flapper is worn out and no longer sealing water from going into bowl.</p>
