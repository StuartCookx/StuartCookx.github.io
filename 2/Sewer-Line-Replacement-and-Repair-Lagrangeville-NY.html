<p>A freshly installed water heater need to not produce strange sounds, but it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder over time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things get worse dramatically for families with a high need for warm water. The factors for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be essential.</p>
