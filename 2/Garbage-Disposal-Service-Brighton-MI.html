<p>Leaks are sly. While the time required will vary based upon your home size and the variety of found breakdowns, it's best to reserve approximately two hours when you set up an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the starting time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the task (unless you have an extremely small plumbing system). When you contact us to arrange your appointment, ask how long the inspection generally takes.</p>
