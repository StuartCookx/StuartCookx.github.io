The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
