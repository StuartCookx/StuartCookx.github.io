<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested each year. Likewise allows provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be evaluated every year to guarantee the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
