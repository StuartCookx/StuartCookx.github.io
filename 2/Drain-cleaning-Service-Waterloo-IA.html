The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to get away.
