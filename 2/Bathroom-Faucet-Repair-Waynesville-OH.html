<p>Hot water heater repair can sometimes be cost-prohibitive. You'll pay for the needed repairs only to face another issue soon thereafter. Constantly continue to run water throughout and after utilizing your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has actually disappeared down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
