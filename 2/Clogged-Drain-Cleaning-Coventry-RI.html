<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Coventry RI</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
