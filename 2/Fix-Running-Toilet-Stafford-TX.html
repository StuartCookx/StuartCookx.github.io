Clamp the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hose pipes must have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap may be used to achieve this, and may be required depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
