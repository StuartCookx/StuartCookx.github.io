The images provide a sample of a backflow device situated behind the water meter.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>
