<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished brine solution after the regeneration cycle. Secure the drain hose safely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes need to have an air space. Completion of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air space may be used to accomplish this, and might be needed depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
