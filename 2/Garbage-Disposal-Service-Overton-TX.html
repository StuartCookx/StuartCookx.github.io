<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
