<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
