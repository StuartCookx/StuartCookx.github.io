<p>Salt-free systems will also lower scale accumulation and offer brighter clothing and softer skin utilizing a much healthier technique. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without needing to add sodium to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative result on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and use no drainage, no salt and no electrical power or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance since the media can last approximately five years without replacing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a regular monthly basis.</p>
<p>The most effective method to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
