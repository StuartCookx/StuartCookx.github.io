<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Decatur TX</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
