<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 typically depending on the length from the main gas line. Installing a gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the backyard costs $300 to $1,400. You might have an issue with high water pressure if your water heater stops working due to sediment build up in the tank. The water pressure constructs and may ultimately trigger the tank to blow up. This causes thousands of dollars in water and property damage to your house.</p>
<p>The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more considerable costs can take place if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for homeowners. A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss. Producers of PVC or polyethylene gas piping and its connecting fittings include Dormont, DriscoPlex, GasTite, Endot, Pro-Flex, Lyall Lyco, Yellowpipe, and others.</p>
