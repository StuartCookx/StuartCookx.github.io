Subsequently residential licenses issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be tested annually. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be tested yearly to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.
