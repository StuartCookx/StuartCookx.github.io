<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection.

When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
