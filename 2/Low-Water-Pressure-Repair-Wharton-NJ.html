<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
