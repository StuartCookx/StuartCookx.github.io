The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater.

<p>Our team at All Stage Plumbing also utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a excellent and long lasting  option for your broken pipes. The pipe lining process includes our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is completely filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and flaws. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes. When the procedure is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be checked one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
