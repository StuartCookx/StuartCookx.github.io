<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
