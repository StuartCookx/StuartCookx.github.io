The gas hot water heater use natural gas or LPG to heat the water. The gas models are likewise cheaper to run than the electrical types and are a preferred for residential and commercial purposes. When it comes to the advantages of electric storage tank water heaters, they are much safer and much easier to keep compared to their gas equivalents.</p>
<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is delicate to water pressure and counts on a good balance of water pressure in order to work effectively. If your showers become disappointing, or it seems little to no water is draining of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair.
