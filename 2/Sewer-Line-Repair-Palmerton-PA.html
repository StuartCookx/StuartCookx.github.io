<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female believed the cost she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way could have conserved her a lot of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>The cost to install a kitchen sink and waste disposal unit averages $1,080 for materials and labor combined or in the range of $601 - $1,559. The total cost differs depending upon the kind of sink and disposal unit you select. Labor for a kitchen sink installation alone will range from $64 to $82.
