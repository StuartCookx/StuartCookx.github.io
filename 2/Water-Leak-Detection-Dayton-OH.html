Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem.

Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to get away. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down lead to a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide years of protection. There are many regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.
