This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older home (developed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of decades, but steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

Roto-Rooter's expert plumbers provide a full series of basement plumbing services and drain cleaning company, however basement floor drain cleaning is one of the most typical. To prep your unit for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I bought independently from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
