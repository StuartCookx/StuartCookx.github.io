<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
