<p>She understood about the service call fee. The 4 On Your Side Examination discovered that's a typical cost. Consumer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a quote from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would provide a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the circumstance before committing to a cost, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
