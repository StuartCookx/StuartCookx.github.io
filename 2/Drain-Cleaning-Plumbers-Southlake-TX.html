The epoxy forms a barrier between the inside of the material and the pipe streaming through it. This repair technique is preferable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals. The technician, Kenny, was respectful, professional and informative! He asked me to look at the camera with him then discussed my alternatives without attempting to oversell me! I would extremely suggest the Clog Dawg for an once or annual inspection if you suspect that roots may be causing havoc in your drainage pipes.</p>
