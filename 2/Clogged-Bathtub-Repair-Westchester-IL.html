Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- normally sodium. The result is water that's been effectively softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute difficult water.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Westchester IL</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water conserves you cash. A clogged kitchen sink is generally a sign of an obstruction in the plumbing system. If the obstruction isn't eliminated, water pressure can develop within the pipe, ultimately causing it to burst. Weak or no flush: The failure to flush your toilet or needing to flush a number of times after one usage indicates it's time for a replacement. It will likely be more economical to replace the toilet rather than repair it.</p>
