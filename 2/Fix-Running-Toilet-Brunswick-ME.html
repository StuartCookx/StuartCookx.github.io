<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
