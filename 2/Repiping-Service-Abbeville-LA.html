A fouled # 2 Check Valve permits the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge.

<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the problem.

At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
